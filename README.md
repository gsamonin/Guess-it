# Guess-it
## Самонин Георгий ИКБО-08-20
THE OBJECT OF THIS GAME IS TO GUESS AN UNKNOWN NUMBER
CALLED THE 'DOWN NUMBER'.  THE GAME IS PLAYED WITH THE
NUMBERS 1 TO 11. YOU WILL BE GIVEN A HAND OF 5
RANDOMLY SELECTED NUMBERS BETWEEN 1 AND 11 . THE 
COMPUTER WILL HAVE A SIMILAR HAND.  THE DOWN NUMBER WILL 
ALWAYS BE THE NUMBER NOT IN EITHER PLAYER HANDS.
        
YOU ALTERNATE MOVES WITH THE COMPUTER. ON ANY MOVE THERE
ARE TWO OPTIONS- GUESS THE DOWN NUMBER OR ASK ABOUT SOME 
NUMBER
        
WHEN A PLAYER GUESSES THE DOWN NUMBER THE GAME STOPS.
IF THE GUESS IS CORRECT THAT PLAYER WINS.
IF THE GUESS IS NOT CORRECT THAT PLAYER LOSES.
        
ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT NUMBERS IN THE OTHER PLAYERS HAND
MUST BE ANSWERED TRUTHFULLY.  A PLAYER MAY'BLUFF' BY
ASKING ABOUT A NUMBER IN HIS OWN HAND.  THE COMPUTER
WILL SOMETIMES DO THIS.
        
A NUMBER MAY BE ASKED ABOUT ONLY ONCE.
